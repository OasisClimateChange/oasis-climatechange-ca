## About our Climate Change software research & development
In 2019 we began researching ways software could help individuals and communities prepare for, respond to, and recover from climate change impacts and natural disasters.

With help from hundreds of people including students, members of the public, non-government organizations, scientists and academics, we've gathered unparalleled insights into the challenges and opportunities ahead, and ways software can help.

We are working on a Climate Change Impact Portal (CCIP) prototype that will help overcome the communication gap between Trusted Authorities and citizens â€“ before, during, and after climate change impacts and natural disasters.

Learn more about these unique insights, and get involved, by visiting our site https://fight.climatechange.ca.
